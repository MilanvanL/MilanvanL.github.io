‘First-Hand Accounts of War’ aims to digitise and preserve the NIOD’s vast collection of war letters.

Goal of this project is not only to make this collection more accessible, but also to create a scholarly digital dataset. In the initial phase of the project we will digitise the collection by scanning, transcribing, and annotating the letters. ‘First-Hand Accounts of War’ wants to take it a step further by also creating a structured, scholarly dataset that can be used in research for the application of, for example, quantitative text analysis. We will use Transkribus for Hand-Written Text Recognition (HTR). This ensures the collection is not only better preserved for future generations, but also made available in a way that offers new research possibilities.
