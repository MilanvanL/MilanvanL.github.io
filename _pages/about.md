Welcome! My name is Milan van Lange and this is my website. I am a PhD-Candidate, working on a research project titled  [War and Emotions](https://www.niod.nl/en/projects/war-and-emotions-mining-expressions-emotionality-dutch-political-and-public-language){:target="_blank"} at the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust, and Genocide Studies in Amsterdam. I am also affiliated to Utrecht University. 

After studying History at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, I worked as a Research Assistant at the NIOD in 2015 and 2016. There, I turned from a rather traditionally educated Cultural Historian into some sort of programming historian, working mainly with digitized data and political records in R (I still like Cultural History, though). 

Since 2015 I am working on identifying, describing, and analyzing emotions in historical texts (parliamentary debates, newspapers, literature) by using text mining techniques. At the moment my main research interests are best summarized as: twentieth-century history, World War II, text and data mining, and – more general – the application of distant reading and data-science techniques in humanities research.  I do not like to use the ambiguous term ‘Digital Humanities’, but that term undeniably gives most people at least a vague notion of what I am doing.

The main purpose of this website/Github page is to have a place to store and share thoughts, work-in-progress, code, academic activities, talks, preliminary results, publications, etc. Please feel free to comment or ask questions by sending me an [e-mail](mailto:m.van.lange@niod.knaw.nl).
