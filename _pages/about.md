Welcome! My name is Milan van Lange and this is my website. I am a PhD-Candidate, working on a research project titled  [War and Emotions](https://www.niod.nl/en/projects/war-and-emotions-mining-expressions-emotionality-dutch-political-and-public-language){:target="_blank"} at the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust, and Genocide Studies in Amsterdam. I am also affiliated to Utrecht University. 

After studying History at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, I worked as a Research Assistant at the NIOD in 2015 and 2016. There, I turned from a rather traditionally educated Cultural Historian into some sort of Programming Historian, working mainly with digitized data and political records (I still like Cultural History, though).

At the moment my main research interests are best summarized as: Twentieth-Century History, World War II, Text and Data Mining, and – more general – the application of computational techniques in the Humanities.  I do not like to use the ambiguous term ‘Digital Humanities’, but that term undeniably gives most people at least a vague notion of what I am doing.

The main purpose of this website/Github page is to have a place to store and share thoughts, work-in-progress, code, academic activities, talks, preliminary results, publications, etc. Please feel free to comment or ask questions by sending me an [e-mail](mailto:m.van.lange@niod.knaw.nl).
