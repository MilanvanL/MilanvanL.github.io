Welcome to the personal website of Milan van Lange. As a PhD-Candidate I am working on a research project titled  [War and Emotions](https://www.niod.nl/en/projects/war-and-emotions-mining-expressions-emotionality-dutch-political-and-public-language) at the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust, and Genocide Studies in Amsterdam. I am also affiliated to Utrecht University. From February till May 2019 worked as a PhD Research Fellow at the The Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH) located in Belval, Luxembourg.

After studying history at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, I worked as a research assistant at the NIOD. There I turned from a rather traditionally educated cultural historian into some sort of programming historian. Nowadays I am working mainly with digitised historical data and political records in the R programming environment. Since 2015 I am working on identifying, describing, and analyzing emotions in historical texts (parliamentary debates, newspapers, literature) by using text mining techniques. 

At the moment my main research interests are best summarized as: twentieth-century history, World War II, text and data mining, and – more general – the application of distant reading and data-science techniques in humanities research. I do not like to use the ambiguous term *digital humanities*, but that term undeniably gives at least a vague notion of the work field.

The main purpose of this website/Github page is to have a place to store and share thoughts, work-in-progress, code, academic activities, talks, preliminary results, publications, etc. Please feel free to comment or ask questions by sending me an [e-mail](mailto:m.van.lange@niod.knaw.nl).
