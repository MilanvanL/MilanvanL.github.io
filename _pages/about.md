Welcome! I am a PhD-Candidate from the Netherlands working on the ‘War and Emotions’-project at the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust, and Genocide Studies in Amsterdam. I am also affiliated to Utrecht University.

After studying History at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, I worked as a Research Assistant at the NIOD in 2015 and 2016. In the last few years, I turned from a traditionally educated Cultural Historian into some sort of programming Historian, working mainly with digitized data and political records (but I still like Cultural History, though). 

At the moment my main research interests are best summarized as: Twentieth-Century History, World War II, Text and Data Mining, and – more general – the application of computational techniques in the Humanities. In general I do not like to use the ambiguous term ‘Digital Humanities’, despite that the word gives most people at least a vague notion of what I am doing.
