Welcome! My name is Milan van Lange and I am working as a PhD-Candidate on my research project called [War and Emotions](https://www.niod.nl/en/projects/war-and-emotions-mining-expressions-emotionality-dutch-political-and-public-language) at the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust, and Genocide Studies in Amsterdam. I am also affiliated to Utrecht University. 

After studying History at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, I worked as a Research Assistant at the NIOD in 2015 and 2016. In the last few years, I turned from a traditionally educated Cultural Historian into some sort of programming Historian, working mainly with digitized data and political records (but I still like Cultural History, though). 

At the moment my main research interests are best summarized as: Twentieth-Century History, World War II, Text and Data Mining, and – more general – the application of computational techniques in the Humanities. In general I do not like to use the ambiguous term ‘Digital Humanities’, despite that the word gives most people at least a vague notion of what I am doing. 

The main purpose of this website/Github page is to have a place to store and share thoughts, work-in-progress, code, academic activities, talks, preliminary results, publications, etc. Please feel free to comment or ask questions by sending me an [e-mail](mailto:m.van.lange@niod.knaw.nl).
