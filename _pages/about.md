At the moment I am working on my PhD-project ‘War and Emotions’ at the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust, and Genocide Studies in Amsterdam. 

I am affiliated to Utrecht University as an external PhD-Candidate. I studied History at the Radboud University in Nijmegen and I worked as a Research Assistant at the NIOD before. In the last few years I turned from a traditionally educated Cultural Historian into some sort of programming Historian, working mainly with digitized data and political records (but I still like Cultural History, though). 

My research interests proved to be subject to development. When I delve into something, interest often follows. At the moment my main research interests are best summarized as: Twentieth-Century History, World War II, Text and Data Mining, and – more general – the application of computational techniques in the Humanities. I do not wish to use the ambiguous term ‘Digital Humanities’ here, although the word gives people at least a vague notion of what I am doing.
