During the online DH Benelux 2020 I presented the working paper 'Vehemence and Victims' with Ralf Futselaar. 
This working paper analyses digitized historical parliamentary debates on post-war welfare legislation for victims of the German 
occupation of the Netherlands.

We confronted a well-researched historical case with an additional, computational approach. This case also allowed
us to explore and evaluate the use of generic emotion lexicons in an innovative approach to historical research.
