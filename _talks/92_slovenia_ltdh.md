We are proposing a method to investigate changes in historical discourse by using large bodies of text and word embedding models. As
a case study, we investigate discussions in Dutch Parliament about the punishment of war criminals in the period 1945-1975.  We will
demonstrate how word embedding models, trained with Googleâ€™s Word2Vec algorithm, can be used to trace historical developments in
parliamentary vocabulary through time.
