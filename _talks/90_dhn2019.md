There appearsto be consensus about the development of an ‘emotional culture’ in the Western World during the second
half of the twentieth century. Emotional expressions supposedly have become more socially acceptable, and such
expressions also became much more common in public discourse. It is a common assumption that an 'emancipation of emotions'
led  to a far-reaching and ongoing ‘emotionalisation’ of Western politics, media, and society. By using generic lexicons of emotional words, we try to find an empirical way to test this 'shared intuition' in collections of digitised historical parliamentary debates and newspapers.
