Together with Dr. Ralf Futselaar I presented our quantitative text analysis research on nuclear weapon debates in Dutch parliament (1975-1990) to the Digital Humanities Group of the Royal Library (KB). We showed how we combined Word Embedding Models based on the Google Word2Vec algorithm and Cosine-Similarity-scores to investigate political speech diachronically.
