(Together with Ralf Futselaar) 
In this presentation, we proposed a method to investigate changes in historical discourse by using large bodies of text and word embedding models. As a case study, we investigated discussions in Dutch Parliament about the punishment of war criminals in the period 1945-1975.  We demonstrated how word embedding models, trained with Googleâ€™s Word2Vec algorithm, can be used to trace historical developments in parliamentary vocabulary through time.

The paper is published in the Proceedings of the Conference on Language Technologies & Digital Humanities 2018. The PowerPointPresentation can be downloaded [here.](http://www.sdjt.si/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/01LangeFutselaar_JTDH2018.pdf)
