The purpose of this course was to familiarize students of the Research MA programme History with computational techniques to analyse structured and unstructured data. More and more historians are using large sets of digital data--both numerical as textual--as well as a growing variety of digital techniques to extract information from this data. Scholars are discussing the disruptive nature of these increasingly common practices for historical scholarship under the header of Digital Humanities and Digital History. It is not only timely to become acquainted with a number of widely used techniques and skills, but also to learn how to use them for the study of history in a critical and conscientious way. A last goal of this course is to provide students with sufficient information to form their own opinion of the extent to which digital resources and tools change the heuristics of historical enquiry.

In this course students will work with tools for the analysis of unstructured (textual) and structured (numerical) historical data within the R environment . Students are trained in the analytical tools in a ‘hands on’ setting, in which they work on their own research projects. Students will work in groups on a paper that answers a research question using both types of data. Students will have to reflect in their research projects on the opportunities, but also the risks and pitfalls of digital tools for this type of historical study. More generally, they will evaluate and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of a selection of books, articles, and working papers that employ digital humanities methods with these tools.
