With my PhD-supervisor dr. Ralf Futselaar I went to Kwansei Gakuin Univesity in Nishinomiya, Japan to visit prof. dr. Yasuto Nakano. We received a grant from the Kwansei Gakuin University Invited Researcher Fund to work together with Yasuto Nakano on, among other things, comparative text mining using Japanese and Dutch digitized parliamentary proceedings. Together with prof. Nakano's students we organized a small seminar to discuss the application of text mining techniques within various fields, ranging from sociology to history.
