The summer school: 'Practices of Remembrance beyond Memory Politics: Recalling Mass Violence and the Roads to Reconciliation in Asia and Europe' took place at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Humanities and Social Sciences in Nanjing, China from 17 till 23 July 2017. It was funded by the China Exchange Programme (CEP) of the KNAW. The aim of this programme was to foster long-term research collaboration between the Netherlands and China by providing seed money for new cooperation.

The participants were a group of selected PhD students, advanced MA students and researchers of various backgrounds in the Netherlands, China and Japan. I received a travel grant to attend the Summer School in Nanjing.
