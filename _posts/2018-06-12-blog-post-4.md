Together with Ralf Futselaar and Gerben Zaagsma (C2DH, University of Luxembourg) I organised a workshop 'Introduction to Text Mining in R and RStudio' at the University of Luxembourg.

Machine readable text corpora are increasingly available to humanities researchers, as well as a growing variety of digital techniques to extract information from this data. The purpose of this introduction to Text Mining and Word Embedding Models in R was to familiarize participants of the workshop with these techniques and to help them incorporate them in their methodological workflow. The workshop outlined the basic steps and methodological considerations the participants needed to start their own Text Mining research project.
