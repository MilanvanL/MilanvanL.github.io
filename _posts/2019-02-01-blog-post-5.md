For three months, I worked as a PhD Research Fellow at the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH). During this fellowship I was part of the Impresso project team at C²DH. The <a href="https://niodbibliotheek.blogspot.com/2019/05/integrating-new-methods-in-historical-research-3.html" target="_blank">NIOD blog</a> published a miniseries of three blogs about my experiences and more about the Impresso research pilot can be found <a href="https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/fr/thinkering/nibbling-text-identifying-discourses-europe-large-collection-historical-newspapers-using" target="_blank">here</a>.
