In the summer of 2019 I attended the 9th Flying University of Transnational Humanities (FUTH) at the Sogang University in Seoul, South Korea. I presented a <a href="https://pure.knaw.nl/portal/en/activities/dont-mention-the-war-references-to-world-war-ii-in-dutch-parliamentary-debates-on-the-indonesian-war-of-independence-19451949(33b3e067-6701-4a88-b3f0-c987a0f11ec5).html
">paper-in-progress</a> on references to World War II in Dutch parliamentary debates on the Indonesian war of independence (1945-1949).

The FUTH has its roots as an underground educational movement in 19th century Warsaw.
During the Nazi occupation of Poland, the FUTH revived to offer alternative education under Nazi control and censorship. The FUTH had a second
revival in 2010, when Jie-Hyun Lim brought the idea back to life again. The 9th FUTH took place at the Sogang University in Seoul. Offical theme of the FUTH 2019 was “The Holocaust Meets the Post-colonial in the Global Memory Space”.
