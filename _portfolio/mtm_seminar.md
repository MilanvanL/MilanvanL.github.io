title: "Mind, Text, and Mining Seminar"
excerpt: "
In collaboration with dr. Martijn Schoonvelde (VU University) and dr. Mark Dechesne (Leiden University) I am organizing a frequently recurring seminar on the quantitative analysis of large text corpora. 

<br/><br/>In various academic fields texts are analysed for indicators of speaker personality, or speaker emotions like disgust, anger, and happiness: concepts which have been shown to drive political behaviour or to represent opinions, attitudes or emotionality in relation to certain topics. Quantitative analysis or ‘mining’ of these psychological constructs in the study of historical, social, and political phenomena is burgeoning.

<br/><br/>To learn more about these developments, we have formed a multidisciplinary group of interested and active researchers in the Netherlands by means of a regularly occurring seminar in which best practices in applied work, new methodologies, and substantive new findings are exchanged and discussed. We aim for a group of committed members who intend to participate on a regular basis.
<br/><br/>

<b> <br/>Upcoming seminar: <br/>


<b>Program of the 8th Mind, Text, and Mining seminar:</b> <br/>

Seminar with Marij Swinkels about cognitive mapping. During this seminar Marij will first explain what cognitive mapping is, with leadership in the European Union as a case study, and how it differs from other text as data approaches. Currently, cognitive mapping requires a lot of input from the researcher. The goal of this hands-on seminar is to develop ideas on how to automate some steps of this approach.
     <br/> <br/>
    About the speaker: Marij Swinkels is a PhD candidate and lecturer at the Utrecht University School of Governance. In her PhD, she focuses on how European political leaders make use of economic ideas in the Eurozone crisis to explain the causes, consequences and solutions of the crisis.
     <br/> <br/>
   <b> Date and time: November 22, 2018, 3-5PM (we will start at 3 PM sharp!)
     <br/> <br/>
    Location: University of Amsterdam, room TBD </b>
