title: "Mind, Text, and Mining Seminar"
excerpt: "
In collaboration with dr. Martijn Schoonvelde (VU University) and dr. Mark Dechesne (Leiden University) I am organizing a frequently recurring seminar on the quantitative analysis of large text corpora. 

<br/><br/>In various academic fields texts are analysed for indicators of speaker personality, or speaker emotions like disgust, anger, and happiness: concepts which have been shown to drive political behaviour or to represent opinions, attitudes or emotionality in relation to certain topics. Quantitative analysis or ‘mining’ of these psychological constructs in the study of historical, social, and political phenomena is burgeoning.

<br/><br/>To learn more about these developments, we have formed a multidisciplinary group of interested and active researchers in the Netherlands by means of a regularly occurring seminar in which best practices in applied work, new methodologies, and substantive new findings are exchanged and discussed. We aim for a group of committed members who intend to participate on a regular basis.

<br/><br/>Next seminar: February 28, 2018
Programme:
•	Welcome by Milan van Lange (NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies).
•	Presentation by Michael Bossetta (University of Copenhagen): “Measuring Deliberation on Social Media as Arguments in Facebook Comments: The Case of Brexit”. (Summary in attachment) 
•	Roundtable discussion. Michael came up with some questions for discussion in advance:
o	How confident should researchers be in using rather 'black box' computational text mining methods, such as the formality score metric used here? 
o	How should the quantitative outputs of text mining methods be interpreted? In our case, should differences in formality scores be interpreted as significantly large or small? 

•   Date and time: February 28, 2018 | 3-5PM (we will start at 3 PM sharp!)
•   Location: Conference room NIOD (first floor), Herengracht 380, Amsterdam
